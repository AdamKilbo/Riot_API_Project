# Riot_API_Project

Project Description:

This project works with the Riot API, designed for developers to gain informaion and insight on League of Legends ingame data.

This code is a crawler type program that will crawl through player's match histories and collect data on champion winrate statistics.

This was made by using Python for the code and Curl for making http requests. I used pip to install curl.
